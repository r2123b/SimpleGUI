# SimpleGUI

Requirement:
Python 3.4

Description:
1. If you wrote a crawler with for-loop or while-loop and the crawler's result will be shown on GUI, this SimpleGUI will help you develop what you need.
2. GUI of Tkinter is also implemented a loop, so I use thread to resolve the situation which run two loops(crawler-loop and GUI-loop) simultaneously
