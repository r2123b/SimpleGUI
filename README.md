# SimpleGUI

Requirement:
Python 3.4

Description:
1. If you are writing a crawler with for-loop or while-loop, and the crawler's results will be shown on GUI, this SimpleGUI will help you develop what you need.
2. GUI of Tkinter is also implemented by a loop, so I use "thread" to resolve the situation which runs two loops(crawler-loop and GUI-loop) simultaneously
